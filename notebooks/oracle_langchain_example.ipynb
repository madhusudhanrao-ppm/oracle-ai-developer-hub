This is a natural paradigm for expressing data processing pipelines, machine learning in particular. We call the graph of operations a flow. You define the operations, called steps, which are nodes of the graph and contain transitions to the next steps, which serve as edges. Metaflow sets some constraints on the structure of the graph. For starters, every flow needs a step called start and a step called end. An execution of the flow, which we call a run, starts at start. The run is successful if the final end step finishes successfully. What happens between start and end is up to you. You can construct the graph in between using an arbitrary combination of the following three types of transitions supported by Metaflow:\",\n",
